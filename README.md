# Children of Morta - Gems Sharing

## Requirements
BepInEx 5.4 (x64) must be installed.  

## What this mod does
All gemstones are shared across players.  
When one player picks up a gem, all players’ counters increase.  
Spending gems is synchronized: merchant purchases reduce everyone’s counter.  
If a run starts with initial gems, they are pooled and redistributed equally (e.g. 2 players with 1 gem each → both start with 2).  

## Why use it
In the base game, gems are divided individually, which often prevents purchases unless one player gathered enough. With this mod, progression is truly cooperative: if the group has enough gems, everyone benefits.  

## Compatibility
Tested on the main story.  

## Installation
Install BepInEx 5.4 in the game folder.  
Copy ChildrenOfMorta_GemsSharing.dll into BepInEx/plugins.  

## Uninstallation
Remove the DLL from BepInEx/plugins.
